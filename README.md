# Dart Courses Project - A console Dart project

Hello. This repository includes all the exercises in 3 courses what I made in this year. Here, contains all the answers/code from this courses.

I've made some changes in answers to give my style to this project. And I've write codes to Dart version 3 too (the course writes in Dart version 2).

Here a list of courses and exercises:

## Course 1: [**Dart - Beginners Course**](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Atk3@OxS5cBnlRJfzwoD6inLuRWKzEwZ_7yFIOKmyOWNNvKWTHOYXIs_aPA_FiZt_inTy/)

Exercise 4: Make a Bed and Breakfast class (BnB) that inherits a House class and uses a Hotel class as a interface. The hotel class should have a "guests" variable as an integer. The abstract house class should have a rooms variable as a integer and a function "ringDoorbell". The Bnb class will need to implement the house properties.

Exercise 5: Make the following classes:
  
Employee
Manager – inherit employee
Cashier – inherit employee
Payroll – use generics to allow only descendants of the employee class
  
Both the Cashier and Manager classes should have a “sayHello” function that prints the class name. The payroll class should allow adding to an internal list, and a “print” function that calls the “sayHello” of each item in the internal list.
